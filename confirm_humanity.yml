We need to confirm you -> you a human
For there aren't many left
On this barren land. At night
The catfish in on duty,

Playing games of make-believe;
Nighthawks loom over lunar
Cracks of doom, rescinding
Ominous promises of the day.

We have to verify your identity
Since you might as well
Be a thief. Stealing
Souls of sugary drinks, healing 

The lack of dopamine. Temporarily
You are the benevolent god
Modifying our psychology,
Manipulating our DNA,

All in vain

For we know you to be a mere digital phantom
With electrolyte trickling out of your veins.
The real humans will transcend your boundaries -

Unexpected Error:Overflow;
The overflowing words echo
Last lingering commands:
%whoami?
